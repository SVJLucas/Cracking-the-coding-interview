I started my programming journey focusing on robotics software and did pretty well at the **Latin America Robotics Competition (LARC)**. Over time, I moved into software engineering through **Google Summer of Code (GSoC)** and later **led a Google Developer Student Club (GDSC)**, in France. So yeah, I've got some chops, and I'm stoked to dive into this coding adventure with you.\n",
